                            <p>The aim of this project is to see if a computer can generate original art in the style of another artist. Using the neural style transfer technique, I was able to stylize thousands of images and feed that through a AC-GAN. You can click <a href="mozGan_v0.html">here</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/sidpremkumar/ML-Art">Github</a> to learn more about how the program works.</p>
                             <img src="images/pic13.gif" alt=""  style="display: block;
    margin: 0 auto; height: 25%; width: 25%; object-fit: contain"/>

                            <br>
                            <p>Above is a GIF of the evolution of the generator. Snapshots were taken every 1000 images asking the generator to predict what the number 0 would look like. Itâ€™s clear that this is a significant upgrade from version 0. After using more training data this shows that it is possible to create original art in the style of another artists. </p>
                            <img src="images/pic14.bmp" alt=""  style="display: block;
    margin: 0 auto; height: 25%; width: 25%; object-fit: contain"/>
                            <br>
                            <p>Above is a still taken after 16,000 iterations. Compared to version 0, there is much more structure and a lot more of the color white. It is clear to see that there is a 0 in that picture. There are still many issues however and it is clear that it is very easy to over train the model with diminishing results. Moving forward I would like to optimize the model and look at <a href="https://github.com/rkjones4/GANGogh">GANGough</a> as a guide. I also would like to explore making the images larger as the small size limits how much style the images can inherit.</p>
